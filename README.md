# qlikblog.ch-line Extension

Qlik Sense Line Extension as a real extension, not a widget only.

After Qlik Sense Version Februar 2022 the widgets doesn't work anymore. 
So I create a extension that shows a horizontal or a vertical line with some nice propertys.

This line would help to create a nice and clear layout that help you to separate some charts from others.
I use the Line Extension a lot to separate the filters from the rest of the charts.
It is a littel bit old school, but sometimes it make more sense to make this than others. 

When you use the line widget, you must not relayout all apps, use the extension and it looks the version with the widget.

For more Information you can also look at https://www.qlikblog.ch/94-line-widget-ersatz-extension, this is in german only blog. 
But it is a very easy extension and it dosm't use some explanations.
