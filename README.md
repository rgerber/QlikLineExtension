# qlikblog.ch-line Extension

Qlik Sense Line Extension as a real extension, not a widget only.
After Qlik Sense Version Februar 2022 the widgets doesn't work anymore. 
So I create a extension that shows a line (horizontal, vertikal) with some propertys.

Try it out and have fun with the extension.
