# qlikblog.ch-line Extension

Qlik Sense Line Extension as a real extension, not a widget only.
After Qlik Sense Version Februar 2022 the widgets doesn't work anymore. 
So I create a extension that shows a line (horizontal, vertikal) with some propertys.

This line would help to create a nice and clear layout that help you to separate some charts from others.
It is a littel bit old school, but sometimes it make more sense to have this. So you must not rebuild all the apps with a new layout.
Have fun with the extension.

For more Information you can also look at https://www.qlikblog.ch/94-line-widget-ersatz-extension, this is in german only blog. 
But it is a very easy extension and it dosm't use some explorations.
